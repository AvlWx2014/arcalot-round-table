## Propose exception for early chair nominations

**Date: 2022-10-05**

> The [Arcalot Charter](https://github.com/arcalot/arcalot-round-table/blob/main/CHARTER.md#chair-elections) mandates a 6 months minimum membership for chair nominations, but the Arcalot organization is less than 6 months old, therefore this proposal is making **any Arcalot member as of the 4th of October 2022 eligible to become an Arcalot Chair** for this election only. In light of the rule change for chair voting, this proposal is open for voting using pull request reviews **until the 12th of October**.
